				<h2>Let Us C</h2>

					Before I start, I want to say I was not a beginner programmer. My programming journey started with C# and Unity, but my game dev interest faded away, and when I found out C# wasn’t cross-platform, I decided to learn something else instead.

I have experience in Java (little) and Python.

I know a ton of C#, enough to make GUI apps in Visual Studio itself.

So enough about me, about the book.

I wanted to learn C and C++. It’s kinda great. At first, I decided to buy a K&R from Amazon, but after seeing the huge price for a paperback edition itself, I decided to look for cheaper alternatives. I found many books.

C In Depth
Advanced C For Programmers

Head First C

Pearson’s K&R Book on C

And tons more.

Then I saw Yashavant Kanetkar’s ‘Let Us C’. As of that date, it was at it’s 17th edition (the most recent one as of now) and mostly had positive reviews on Amazon. And the price- ULTRA CHEAP for a programming book. Seriously, 330 rupees? Dude, that is way cheap than 90% publishers out there with ultra-priced books. I decided to have some references before buying, of course (do not expect me to buy something quickly because it was cheap) and saw some answers on Stack Overflow and Quora. Many people called it ‘trash’. Many people called it ‘outdated’. Many people also said it wasn’t a ‘good book for beginners’.

I disagree with these statements. I don’t know about the previous editions of this book, I am talking about the 17th one. And I obviously disagree.

I decided to buy it anyway thinking that it had positive reviews on Amazon itself. When I bought it, I was surprised to see the lies people fed about this book.

Myth #1 : His code samples only run on Turbo C/C++ compilers

Wrong. I used CodeBlocks (which uses the MinGW compilers gcc and g++ btw) and saw there was nothing wrong with his code.

Turns out, it worked fine.

Maybe it is because the newest edition had covered these issues? Maybe the people were wrong? Maybe the people’s answers were old?

I don’t know. What I can say is the code samples in the 17th edition are working on GNU GCC compilers, without any warnings.

Myth #2 : Most of his code samples produce undefined behaviour

False. Just like Myth #1’s debunking, no errors came with his code samples in the 17th edition.

Now I am going to talk about the PROS & CONS of this book.

Pros:

Teaches effectively
Doesn’t assume programming backgrounds
Has interview FAQs
Explains about pointers neatly, considering pointers are a burden in both C and C++
Has a lot of exercises on each chapter to test your skills (also contains a major flaw which will be told in cons)
He also explains things about both 32-bit and 16-bit compilers, so I do not see why people complain about this….
Contains major C concepts like file I/O, command line programs and preprocessor directives (macros)
Is extremely cheap compared to other programming books (value may vary depending on your currency)
Has revision notes (called KanNotes in the book) at the end of each chapter, for revising about what you’ve learned and not bothering to read everything in that chapter again
Cons:

You might need an instructor to guide you as the chapters are lecture oriented
Majority of the exercises involve tough math (not recommended if you are weak at math) including trigonometry, calculus and advanced algebra
Even though it explains pointers neatly, it doesn’t explain the dangers associated with memory allocation. Also, it doesn’t tell you to use free() after using malloc() on any variable therefore, you’re relying on your OS to take back the allocated memory for you
The book tries to cram too many things into a chapter, another reason why an instructor is useful for this book, like in Chapter 1 itself instead of a Hello World program Kanetkar just brings out a beginner-overwhelming salary calculator, and also tries to cram scanf(), printf(), and variables, as well as arithmetic operators in the first chapter itself
The book assumes you’re studying in a college/university for computer science, not good for self teaching
Book is also not beginner-friendly even though it assumes you have no programming background.
Given the pros and cons, I wouldn’t just jump and say it sucks for people. I don’t know, majority of the answers here are before 2–3 years, so they’re probably about older editions. So, I might think they’re right about the old ones. But for the 17th edition, everything is revamped, and now, the book doesn’t starting turbo-ing with turbo compilers but instead also talk about 32-bit compilers.

Although I will do warn self-taught programmers and weak math learners that this book assumes a college/university admission as well has the exercises heavily math-oriented.

What I said above only applies for the 17th edition, I don’t know what the heck Kanetkar did in his previous editions that he got such a hate cult. Thanks for reading!

long answer btw… oof

P.S. Also, please do not take my answer to your heart. Only you know what is best for you. If you like ‘Let Us C’, go ahead and buy it. If you think another way is better for you, choose that. Remember, these answers are only people’s experiences and it may not mean you’ll experience the same thing.
